Even more than that though, we realized that grade school simply didn't provide enough (or any) resources for students to learn and explore about career opportunities.</p><h2 class="h3">My Role</h2><p>As the technical co-founder of the 2 man team, I was responsible for creating the user experience of StudentHero as well as developing our core platform. I created a custom referral system for StudentHero that ranks users according to their referral count using the Laravel framework, and I created and designed a custom blog platform. The landing page design was the product of a collaboration with myself and a designer. I used Laravel, Bootstrap, Foundation, SASS, HTML5, and PHP.</p><img src="/images/projects/studenthero/application.png" alt="StudentHero Application" class="img-responsive"><br><img src="/images/projects/studenthero/homepage.png" alt="StudentHero Homepage" class="img-responsive"><br><img src="/images/projects/studenthero/blog_post.png" alt="StudentHero Homepage" class="img-responsive"></div><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function (b, o, i, l, e, r) {
